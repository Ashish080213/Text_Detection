# Text_Detection

Character Detection and Bounding Box Formation
This project utilizes OpenCV and Pytesseract to detect characters in an image, extract the text from the characters, and draw bounding boxes around them. By combining image processing techniques and OCR capabilities, the program automates the process of character detection and provides a visual representation of the detected characters.

Key features:

Uses OpenCV for image reading and preprocessing.
Integrates with Pytesseract for text extraction from the characters.
Generates bounding boxes around each detected character.
Displays the processed image with bounding boxes and character labels.
This project is useful for applications involving text extraction, document analysis, and image processing. It provides a foundation for further development and can be easily integrated into other projects or used as a standalone solution.

To use the project, ensure that the dependencies (OpenCV, Pytesseract, and Tesseract OCR) are installed. Modify the code to specify the input image path, and run the program to see the results.

Contributions and improvements are welcomed, as this project can be extended and customized for specific needs.
